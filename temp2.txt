help me create a webapp

it visualizes data, can you use python. We will use snowflake as well, SQL, java, Scala

1st the user selects (radio buttons):
1. Goal 
{
options: 
1.New car / Used car (toggle)
2. Model (drop down list of mercedes/mayback models)
3. Year (drop down list between current year and past 6 years)
4. Max mileage (of used cars)
}

2. Financing / Cash (toggle)
if Financing:
{
1. Max EMI (textbox)
2. Max Financing term (text box)
3. Max Down Payment (text box)
}
The webapp sends these values to the server, server responds with following values to display:

1. Time chart, showing progress towards meeting the goal of purchasing car based on internal projects

2. Estimated Date, and Down Payment Value, and Car Price

3. Button to Save the data of the customer (working button), and they would have a log in.

4. Ability to notify the webapp user if there is a promotion on the car they are looking for, or to cross sale leasing contracts for housing or investment products 

5. Ability of user to change at any time the inputed data, and for the webapp to always dynamically update
